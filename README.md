## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Not sure how this works, but we shall try!  

Hi, my name is AngusRed

I am a Lead Technical Security Recruiter for the highest bidder. I have been involved in infosec for the last 4 years and have contributed as much as I can to the [community](https://github.com/AngusRed/Security-Community-Involvement). I am a former PARATROOPER(UK) and served for 6 years, afterwich I got into High Risk Security Consulting. I love OSINT, Forensics and hope to be DFIR consultant one day.
